# array is an object that provides a mechanism to store data..
# array is benificial if you store data of same datatype..

# in py array's size is dynaamic
# ex of arr = group of student , group of employes , gropus of dogs.
# ex = group of integer

# imp
# array and list are not same..
# array use less memory than list

# why do we need array??
# to store data of same type

# types of arr
# one dimensional array= [101,102,103,104]
# multi d array = [[100,200,300] [201,203]]

# IMP = python doesnot support multidimensional array , we can still use it by use it using numpy..
